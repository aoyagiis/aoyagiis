- if you haven't read my rentry fully yet feel free to do so

- if i'm afk on pt (i often am,) feel free to whisp me something if you needed to talk to me
- i also have a guestbook but i check it a bit less frequently than i should so feel free to whisp if you sent smth important (or just stop by to say hey)
- i hide people freely for my own comfort
- i don't get on this game often and if i do it's probably only for my close friends lol
- i'm not gonna fight you over dumb shit. i don't have the energy to do so, sorry
